    <h1 class="centered">Types of PC's</h1>
    <h2 class="centered">
        There are many types of personal computers, here are the main types</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>Desktops</h2>
    <h3>
        Desktop computers are one of the most common types of PC.
        They are designed to be used on a desk and can't really be moved. Compared to laptops they offer much less
        convenience
        but they make up with much better performance, upgradability, and cooling. Desktop computers are the best
        choice if you want the best performace and don't care about portability.</h3>

    <h2>Laptops</h2>
    <h3>
        aptops are defenitly the most common type of computer because of their
        portabily, price, and low power consumtion compared to standard desktops. the downside to laptops is their
        decreased performance and cooling, a laptop with the same specs as a desktop will always be worse
        and run a lot hotter. Overall laptops are the best choice if you want a computer that is easy to use, setup, and
        move around.</h3>

    <h2>Mini PC's</h2>
    <h3>
        The last type of PC is the mini PC, it "claims" to offer the best of both
        desktops and laptops, but in reality it falls short on both ends. Mini PC's are small and seamless like laptops
        but offer
        increased performance and cooling like desktops. even though they are trying to be similar to desktops,
        they generally have much worse specs because of limited space. Overall mini PC's arent horible and new mini PC's
        like the Mac mini are really starting to get better, but if you know how to use them they may be a good option
        for you.
