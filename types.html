        <h1 class="centered">Types of PC's</h1>
        <h3 style="padding: 10px 20px 15px 5px;">
        There are many types of personal computers, some of the many types inlude: desktops, laptops, and mini PC's.
        Although there are more types, these are the main kinds.</h3>
        <br>
        <h2 style="padding: 10px 20px 15px 5px;">Desktops</h2>
        <h3 style="padding: 10px 20px 15px 5px;">
            Desktop computers are one of the most common types of PC.
            They are designed to be used on a desk and can't really be moved. Compared to laptops they offer much less convenience
            but they make up with much better performance, upgradability, and cooling. Desktop computers are the best 
            choice if you want the best performace and don't care about portability.</h3>

        <h2 style="padding: 10px 20px 15px 5px;">Laptops</h2>
        <h3 style="padding: 10px 20px 15px 5px;">
            laptops are defenitly the most common type of computer because of their
            portabily, price, and low power consumtion compared to standard desktops. the downside to laptops is their
            decreased performance and cooling, a laptop with the same specs as a desktop will always be worse
            and run a lot hotter. Overall laptops are the best choice if you want a computer that is easy to use, setup, and move around.</h3>

        <h2 style="padding: 10px 20px 15px 5px;">Mini PC's</h2>
        <h3 style="padding: 10px 20px 15px 5px;">
            The last type of PC is the mini pc, it "claims" to offer the best of both 
            desktops and laptops, but in reality it falls short on both ends. Mini PC's are small and seamless like laptops but offer 
            increased performance and cooling like desktops. even though they are trying to be similar to desktops,
            they generally have much worse specs because of limited space. Overall mini PC's arent horible and new mini PC's
            like the Mac mini are really starting to get better, but if you know how to use them they may be a good option for you.
