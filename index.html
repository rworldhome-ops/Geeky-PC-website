        <h2>History of PC's</h2>
        <h3>
            Personal computers (PCs) started to become widely available in the 1970s. 
            Before this time, computers were very large and expensive machines used
            mainly by governments, universities, and large companies. 
            They were huge and filled entire rooms they definitely weren't designed for personal use.</h3>

        <h3>
            In the mid-1970s, technology improved and computers became smaller and more affordable.
            One of the first successful personal computers was the Apple II, released in 1977.
            In 1981, IBM released the IBM PC, which became very popular and helped set the standard for many modern computers.</h3>
